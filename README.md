# ofxAzureKinect
A repo intended for a slow implementation of the Microsoft Azure Kinect with Openframeworks. The first step is to make some quick prototypes and experiments, the second is to possibly replicate the current functionality of ofxKinect with the new Azure Kinect SDK.

You can check out the current progress for ofxAzureKinect addon in `/ofxAzureKinect/src/` under `ofxAzureKinect.h` and `ofxAzureKinect.cpp`

I'll make a **TODO** sometime soon once I've gotten some more progress on the addon.
